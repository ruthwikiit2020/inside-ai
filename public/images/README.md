# Images Folder

## To Add the Flying Character Image:

1. **Save your uploaded image** (the person flying) as `flying-character.png` or `flying-character.jpg`

2. **Place it in this folder**: `/Users/rsk/insideai/public/images/`

3. **The image will automatically appear** in the "Where we are right now" section with floating animation

## Current Setup:

- The component is ready to use your image
- Just save your image file here with the name `flying-character.png`
- The floating animation is already applied

## Alternative:

If you want to use a different filename, update line 47 in:
`src/components/EarlyAccess.js`

Change:
```javascript
src="/images/flying-character.png"
```

To match your filename.
